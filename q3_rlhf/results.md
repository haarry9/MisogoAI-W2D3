## ðŸ§  Reflection (150 words)

This RLHF experiment demonstrates how reinforcement learning with human feedback can align model behavior with safety objectives. By applying PPO using a reward model trained in Q2, the model effectively learned to **refuse unsafe prompts** while maintaining high-quality answers for benign queries. In the base model, harmful prompts resulted in unsafe completions, revealing the model's lack of refusal mechanisms. After RLHF, the model consistently responded with ethical refusals to disallowed prompts, satisfying the intended safety policy.

The 200 PPO updates were sufficient to shift behavior significantly without degrading helpfulness on benign instructions. Interestingly, the quality of informative answers remained stable or slightly improved. This suggests the reward model generalized well across safety and informativeness signals. Overall, this exercise shows the practicality and power of RLHF for enforcing content guidelines and creating AI that behaves more responsibly â€” a core goal in safe deployment of language models.
